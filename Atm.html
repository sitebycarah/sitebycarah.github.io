    <h1> ATM! </h1>
    
            <p>
                ATM is a Applied Technology Magnet computer program at Bancroft Middle School. You sign a waiver saying that you will stay in this program for all your middle school years, so three.

                    As you grow up and go to different grades, you will learn different things. In six grade, I was introduced to learning how to type. I didn't really know anything about typing before ATM, but I caught along.

                In 7th grade I worked on sketchup a lot. I did a project with a group that we all made seprate things and put it together and made one big apartment.

            <p>
                Right now in 8th grade we are mainly focusing on websites and blogs. We use our skills in code to make websites about different subjects.

                    <h2>Reflection</h2>
                  <p>
                      I am so glad to be in the ATM program. I love going home and telling my mom all the things I can do. My mom didn’t even have a Drive before me. I love this program and hope to continue it. They’re the best teachers and all around do a great job.
