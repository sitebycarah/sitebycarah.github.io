            <p>
                ATM is a Applied Technology Magnet computer program at Bancroft Middle School. You sign a waiver saying that you will stay in this program for all your middle school years, so three.

                    As you grow up and go to different grades you will learn different things. In six grade I was introduced to learning how to type. I didn't really know anything about typing before ATM, but I caught along.
