            <h2>My family!</h2>
                <p>
                    I love my family so much. I have a mom and dad of course, and three other siblings. I have a younger sister that is in first grade and loves to do homework. I also have two older brothers, one that works all the time and one that is training to be in the Coast Guard. My mom and dad knew eachother since they were kids. At first my mom didn't really like my dad, but everyone knew she would come around.

            <h2> Hobbies and Skills </h2>    
                <p>
                    My hobbies are riding dirtbikes, racing BMX, cheer leading, and wake boarding. I enjoy doing all of these things because it gets my energy up and I am always excited to do them. When ever I go to the desert to ride my dirtbike, I always try to keep up with my brothers. My brothers are generally fast, but I am always right there with them. When I raced BMX I was in the top 3 for nationals in my age group. I think these are my favorite hobbies that me and my family do.
